# TypeScript Snippets

 ```tsx

interface Cat {
  name: string,
  age: number
}

type CatProperty = keyof Cat;

type CatLabels {[k in CatProperty]: string}

// OR

type CatLabelsRecord = Record<CatProperty, string>

type Foo = 'a' | 'b';
type Bar = {[key in Foo]: any};
Though Bar has no index signature (i.e., you can't then do (obj as Bar)[value as Foo]).

Edit: Though if you could make the caveat a non-issue, I'd be eternally grateful!

Use Record instead!

type Foo = 'a' | 'b'
type Bar = Record<Foo, any>
 
 ```
