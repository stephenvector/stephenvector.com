# Stop Copying Blank Selections In VSCode

VSCode copies blank selections by default. Here's how to change this behavior.

Open Preferences -> Settings

In "Editor" section, uncheck "Empty Selection Clipboard (Controls whether copying without a selection copies the current line.)"

or in settings.json:

```
editor.emptySelectionClipboard: false
```
